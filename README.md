## Success of Kickstarter Campaigns Based on Launch Date and Funding Goals
  The purpose of this analysis is to determine the optimal timing and goals of a Kickstarter campaign to maximize funding success.
  
### Conclusions Based on Launch Date
  Based on the data that we have, the most advantageous time to begin a campaign is in the spring. From the peak at the beginning of the Second Quarter of the year, a steady decline in success was demonstrated by the data.  A campaign started in the Fourth Quarter demonstarted the least amount of success.

### Conclusions Based on Goals
  Based on the data we have, a campaign with a goal of less than $5,000.00 is more likely to succeed than a campaign with a goal above $5,000.00.  A significant drop-off in sucess is demonstrated by the data.

### Limitations of the Dataset
  One possible limitation of the dataset is that by definition it is looking at campaigns that have taken place in previous years.  As societies, economies and trends evolve, previous results and norms may no longer apply at the same standards.  
  
### Additional Analysys
  Additional tables and graphs that coulu be created would be visuals that demonstarte the success of relevant campaigns over a year-by-year basis to possibly identify longer term societal and/or economic trands.
